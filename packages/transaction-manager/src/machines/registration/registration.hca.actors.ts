/**
 * Standalone-HCA registration actors (user-paid USDC route).
 *
 * These target the STANDALONE-HCA deployment (via `@ens-apps/smart-account`'s
 * manifest) — a different contract set from the chain's ENS contracts, which the
 * pure-EOA path (portal) keeps using untouched.
 *
 * Route shape (per the "HCA: New" handoff doc; NO gas sponsorship):
 *   - Commit leg (first HCA action, session-signed, one request):
 *       USDC.permit(wallet, HCA, budget)        — only when funding is needed
 *       USDC.transferFrom(wallet, HCA, budget)  — only when funding is needed
 *       ETHRegistrar.commit(commitment)
 *     The same request lazily deploys the HCA. Like every session-signed
 *     intent, it carries the session authorization as `enableData`: the
 *     validator keeps no session state. `sponsored: { gas:false,
 *     bridging:false, swaps:false }`, `feeAsset: 'USDC'` — execution costs are
 *     refunded from the HCA's USDC.
 *   - Reveal leg (after cooldown, session-signed, no wallet prompt):
 *       price re-read immediately before; exact-ordered reveal batch from
 *       `buildRevealBatch` (deployProxy? → approve(price) → register(wallet) →
 *       setters → setNameWithHCA?).
